h1. Configliere

bq. So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.

Wise, lightweight configuration management for ruby programs.

You've got a script. It's got some settings. Some settings are for this module, some are for that module. Most of them don't change. Except on your laptop, where the paths are different.  Or when you're in production mode. Or when you're testing from the command line.

A good configliere provides wise counsel and make problems go away. Design goals:

* *No drama*. Requires almost no external resources and almost no code in your script.
* *Don't mess with my crew*. Settings for a model over here don't affect settings for a model over there, and don't require asking the boss to set something up.
* *Be willing to sit down with the Five Families*. Takes settings from (at your option):
** Pre-defined defaults from constants (lowest precedence -- always loses)
** Simple config file
** Environment variables
** Commandline options
** Ruby block called when all other options are in place (highest precedence -- always wins)
* *Be discreet*. Most commandline parsers force you to pre-define all your parameters in a centralized and wordy syntax. In configliere, you pre-define nothing -- commandline parameters map directly to values in the Configliere hash.
* *Know how to keep a frickin secret*. Rather than storing passwords and API keys in plain sight, configliere can provide protection and obscuring its value when stored to disk.

h2. Settings structure

Configliere settings are just a plain old normal hash. 

You can define static defaults in your module

    Config.defaults({
      :dest_time => '1955-11-05',
      :fluxcapacitor => {
        :speed => 88,
        },
      :delorean => {
        :power_source => 'plutonium',
        :roads_needed => true,
        },
      :username => 'marty',
      :password => '',
    })

Configliere doesn't load any other functionality by default -- you may not want to load config files, or environment variable handling, and so forth.  You can require each file directly, or call @Configliere.use@ with the mixins to require (:all to load all functionality).

    Configliere.use :param_store, :define # Load config files and pre-define 
    Configliere.use :all                  # all of them

h2. Configuration files

Call Config.read(:my_settings_group) to read a param group from the YAML global config file (Configliere::DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE, normally ~/.configliere.yaml)

    # Settings for version II.
    :time_machine:
      :dest_time:        2015-11-05
      :delorean:
        :power_source:    Mr. Fusion
        :roads_needed:    ~

You can instead supply a path to a config file.  If a bare filename (no '/') is given, configliere looks for the file in Configliere::DEFAULT_CONFIG_DIR (normally ~/.configliere)

    Config.read(:time_machine)             # looks in ~/.configliere.yaml, and extracts the :time_machine group
    Config.read('/etc/time_machine.yaml')  # looks in /etc/time_machine.yaml
    Config.read('time_machine.yaml')       # looks in ~/.configliere/time_machine.yaml

When you read directly from a file you should leave off the top-level settings group:
    
    # Settings for version II.
    :dest_time:         2015-11-05
    :delorean:
      :power_source:    Mr. Fusion
      :roads_needed:    ~

You can save defaults with

    Config.save(:time_machine)            # merges into ~/.configliere.yaml, under :time_machine
    Config.save('/etc/time_machine.yaml') # overwrites /etc/time_machine.yaml
    Config.save('time_machine.yaml')      # overwrites ~/.configliere/time_machine.yaml
    
h2. Environment Variables

    Config.use_environment 'DEST_TIME', 'TM_PASS' => 'password', 'POWER_SOURCE' => 'delorean.power_source'

A dot in the 

h2. Command-line parameters

    # Head back
    time_machine --delorean-power_source='1.21 gigawatt lightning strike' --dest_time=1985-11-05 
    # (in the time_machine script:)
    Config.use :commandline

Interpretation of command-line parameters:
* *name-val params*: --param=val sets @Configliere[:param]@ to val.
* *boolean params*: --param sets @Configliere[:param]@ to be true. --param='' sets @Configliere[:param]@ to be nil. 
* *scoped params*: --group-sub_group-param=val sets @Configliere[:group][:subgroup][:param]@ to val (and similarly for boolean parameters).
** A dash or dot within a parameter name scopes that parameter: @--group.sub_group.param=val@ and @--group-sub_group-param=val@ do the same thing. A _ within a parameter name is left as part of the segment.
** Only [\w\.\-]+ are accepted in parameter names. 
* *Config.rest*: anything else is stored, in order, in @Config.rest@.
* *stop marker*: a -- alone stops parameter processing and tosses all remaining params (not including the --) into Config.rest.

Here are some things you don't get:
* There are no short parameters (-r, etc).
* Apart from converting '' (an explicit blank string) to nil, no type coercion is performed on parameters unless requested explicitly (see below).
* No validation is performed on parameters.
* No ordering or multiplicity is preserved (you can't say --file=this --file=that).

h2. Fancy Parameters

You don't have to pre-define parameters, but you can:

    Config.use :define
    Config.define :dest_time, :type => Date, :description => 'Arrival time. If only a date is given, the current time of day on that date is assumed.'
    Config.define 'delorean.power_source', :description => 'Delorean subsytem supplying power to the Flux Capacitor.'
    Config.define :password, :required => true, :obscure => true

* *:type*: converts params to a desired form. It understands Date, Time, Integer, :boolean and Symbol. :blank => nil and :blank => false.
* *:description* documents a param.
* *:required* marks params required. Any required parameter found to be nil raises an error (listing all missing params)
* *:obscured* marks params to be encrypted when saved to disk. See [#Obscured Parameters] below for caveats.

h2. Ruby Block

    Config.finally do |c|
      c.dest_time = (Time.now + 60) if c.username == 'einstein'
      # you can use hash syntax too
      c[:dest_time] = (Time.now + 60) if c[:username] == 'einstein'
    end

Configliere 'finally' blocks are called after everything but required parameter
    
h2. Obscured Parameters

bq.  There are two kinds of cryptography in this world: cryptography that will
  stop your kid sister from reading your files, and cryptography that will stop
  major governments from reading your files. This book is about the latter.
  -- Preface to Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier

Configliere provides the latter.  Anyone with access to the script, its config files and the config file passphrase can recover the plaintext password. Still, there's a difference between having to find a paperclip and jimmy open your annoying brother's stupid journal and being able to open to any page.

h3. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send a pull request to github.com/mrflip
* Drop a line to the mailing list for infochimps open-source projects, infochimps-code@googlegroups.com
