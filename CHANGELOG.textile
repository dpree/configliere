Note that while the version # is still in the 0.0.x range, the interface may change arbitrarily while we figure out the best simplest convenientest powerfullest way to arrange things

h2. Version 0.0.6 2010-04-05

* configliere/define and configliere/config_file are included by default.
* fixed a bug when ENV['HOME'] is missing (running as root)

h2. Version 0.0.4 2010-01-16

* Cured a variety of issues noted by "@monad":http://github.com/monad -- thanks for the feedback!

h2. Version 0.0.3 2010-01-15

* @Settings.param@ now only works for params that have been @#define@'d :
<pre>
    Settings :no_yuo => 'oops'
    Settings.no_yuo
    #=> NoMethodError: undefined method `no_yuo' for {:no_yuo=>"oops"}:Configliere::Param
    Settings.define :happy_param, :default => 'yay'
    Settings.happy_param
    #=> "yay" 
</pre>

* Note that you *must* use symbols as keys (except for dotted notation for deep keys). See the README.
* You must now define environment variables using @Settings.env_vars :param => 'ENV_VAR'@. The order was switched to consistently use param as the key. Also, @environment@ was renamed to @env_var@ to avoid confusion with the "development/test/production" convention from rails and friends.
* die takes an error code as option
* Added example scripts for encrypted and config_block scripts
* The directory path to a config_file will now be created automatically
